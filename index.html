                Hello my name is Ye Chan Lee and I'm currently working as a research associate at UCLA. 
                I'm a recent graduate with a major in Computational Biology and a double minor 
                in Japanese and Digital Humanities. Ever since I was a kid, 
                I always indecisive and wanted to try as many things as possible. This translated  
                into my education as well as career path where I have invested time in multiple areas 
                of study. I'm not sure which industry I'll have a career in the future, but I can 
                definitely see myself moving on to different places.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of my hobbies include playing video games, watching anime/reading manga, and enjoying music. My favorite genre of 
                games is RPG because I always found fun to be different characters and exploring whatever storylines 
                the protagonists has to go through. Recently, I've been playing Pokémon Sword and catching shinies. For anime, I haven't 
                been watching recently because Fall 2019 did not have the best lineup; however, I'm excited for the upcoming season. One of
                the major reasons why I decided to minor in Japanese was due to my enjoyments in Japanese video games and other subcultures. I do think
                it would be exciting to live in Japan one day. Finally, I like listening to music and going to concerts and karaoke. 
                As per usual, I listen to a bunch of different genres and I do not mind listening to all of them in one playlist.
